=begin
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple like so: (index1, index2).
For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).
=end

def twoSum(numbers, target)
numbers.each_with_index do |n1, i1|
    numbers.each_with_index do |n2, i2|
      return [i1, i2] if (n1 + n2) == target && i1 != i2
    end
  end
end

puts twoSum([1,2,3], 4);
# 0 2
